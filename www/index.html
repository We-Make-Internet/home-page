<aside>thank you sarah for reminding us that we should have this up</aside>

<p>
Alex's blog is <a href="https://thefloatingcontinent.com">thefloatingcontinent.com</a>.
The concept of a floating continent comes up a lot in children's literature, but if we're being
honest the specific floating continent he's referencing is the one in Final Fantasy III.
You can find all his socials on <a href="https://alexpetros.com">alexpetros.com</a>.
Just follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alexwpetros/">the instagram</a> if anything; he's
protesting twitter and has thus far failed to commit to an alternative.

<p>
Morry is WTTDOTM everywhere. It's an acronym for "Welcome to the Desert of the Meme", which was
the title of his very successful, now abandoned
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/welcometothedesertofthememe/">Facebook Meme Page</a>.
You can find all his socials on <a href="https://wttdotm.com">wttdotm.com</a>.
He went a little aggressive with the minimalism there.
