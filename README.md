# We Make Inter.Net

The homepage.

## Development
`npm install -g serve` to get the local development server. The Makefile uses `serve` because it's
widely available and will serve `.html` files without the file extension i.e. `about.html` is
available at `/about`.

`make` to run it locally.

Deploy the files at `html`.
